            Cameron served as an infantryman in the Indiana Army National Guard through his first bachelors degree in physics from Indiana University, Bloomington. Upon graduation from Indiana University, Cameron taught himself computer programming with the help of Harvard University's <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science" class="project-link" target="_blank">free online classes</a>. As a software engineer, he contributed to various space and defense projects at NASA's Stennis Space Center, The National Air and Space Intelligence Center, and DARPA through <a href="https://www.radiancetech.com/" class="project-link" target="_blank">Radiance Technologies</a>. He
            also contributed to engineering efforts at <a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/who-we-are/business-sectors/mission-systems" class="project-link" target="_blank">Northrop Grumman's Xetron</a>. On leaving space and defense, Cameron focused on computer graphics and performance. He taught himself the fundamentals of computer graphics and secured positions as a senior software engineer focusing on optimization and performance with Advanced Micro Devices and, later, Intel Corporation. While working full time at Intel Corporation, Cameron completed three semesters of masters coursework in economics from Southern New Hampshire University with a 4.0 GPA.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cameron left Intel Corporation and his economics studies following the events of January 6th, 2021 to study philosophy.
